Import regular expressions into memory.  We will need these to define what kinds of words Python is looking for in different commands.

Open the list of stop words we have in the file called 'words' and assign the file to a variable
Look at each word, and convert any capital letters to lowercase

Create an empty SET called 'stops', so we can use our words more effectively in Python
Look at each word in the file 'words'.  Remove the whitespace, and add it to the SET called 'stops'.


Look at the SET 'stops' so we can make sure we have what we want.


Open the text file called 'lovecraft' 
Look at each word, and convert any capital letters to lowercase

Create an empty LIST called 'words', so we can use our text more effectively in Python
Look at each word in the file 'lovecraft'.  Remove the whitespace, and add it to the LIST called 'words'.  BUt onlu find words that use a-z, hyphens and apostrophes.

Create a third empty LIST called 'wcount'
Go through the LIST of words we created from the lovecraft text.
Compare each one to the SET of stopwords we created.

If the word is not in the SET of stopwords, then we add it to the LIST wcount

Show how many unique words we found in the lovecraft stories.  
Show the first 100 words in the list...
